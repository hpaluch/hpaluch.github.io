Please visit my:

* [GitHub Wiki pages](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki)

  at my spare time
* [Work GitHub projects](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch) - these I make

## How are these pages generated

I use [Jekyll support on GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

I just commit to `master` branch of this Git project:

* GIT+SSH:  `git@github.com:hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io.git`
* GIT+HTTPS: `https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io.git`

You can read step-by-step setup instructions on public URL:
