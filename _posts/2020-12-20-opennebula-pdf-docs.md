title: Build latest OpenNebula PDF docs
layout: post

I spent last few days exploring [OpenNebula](https://opennebula.io/). 
As usual I typically start downloading PDF documentation and reading
it on my tablet - which is most convenient for me.

However when I looked here:
- <http://docs.opennebula.io/pdf>

Last available PDF documentation was for `5.10.1` (as of 2020-12-21), although
latest product release is `5.12`. So I looked into details
and generate PDF docs by myself.

- Here my guide how you can generate these PDF manuals by yourself

- And here PR that should fix LaTeX errors (but it is a bit controversial :-)
